# Airline_Passengers_Tickets_Sales_Prediction_using_Time_Series_Forecasting
The objective of this project is to implemented and  explore different Time series Forecasting techniques like **ARIMA, SARIMA, PROPHET and XGBOOST** on a relatively simple and clean dataset.   
The dataset used in this project is International airline passengers dataset. It contains monthly total number of passengers (in thousands) and has two columns – month and count of passengers.

• Analyzed the given data to check for stationarity & decomposed it to get level, trend, seasonality, and residue.

• Performed ADF test for stationarity & used ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet and XGBoosT to predict future sales.

• Achieved best accuracy of 19.23% MAPE in SARIMA & 14.27% MAPE by implementing the Prophet model.
